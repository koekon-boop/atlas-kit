#
# Why a script instead of a Dockerfile/compose change: recreating the container
# wipes Claude Code's auth (/root/.claude is in the writable layer, not a mount),
# so we never rebuild just to run services. This starts them in a detached tmux
# session, loading secrets from .env at runtime.
#
# Persistence across `docker restart` / host reboot (no rebuild): `install-boot`
# drops a /etc/profile.d hook. The image CMD is a login shell (`bash -lc`), which
# sources /etc/profile.d/*.sh on every container start — so the hook re-runs this
# (backgrounded, idempotent) and the services come back up. The profile.d file
# lives in the writable layer (survives restart; wiped only on a full recreate —
# re-run `serve.sh install-boot` if that ever happens).
#
# Usage: serve.sh [ensure|restart|stop|status|install-boot]

# Non-interactive launches (systemd atlas-kit.service) inherit no $HOME, so git can't

# github.com" prompt. Default HOME so git auth works in the spawned workers.
export HOME="${HOME:-/root}"

# …and the same launches inherit cron's/systemd's bare PATH, which omits
# $HOME/.local/bin — where `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` can put `claude`.
# The tmux SERVER started here hands its env to every pane, so without this an API
# brought up by the watchdog cron spawns agents that ENOENT while an interactive
# `serve.sh restart` works. The API also resolves an absolute `claude` itself
# (api/src/claude-bin.mjs); this is the belt to that pair of braces.
