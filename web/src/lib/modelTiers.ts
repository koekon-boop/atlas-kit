/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * What the spawn form's MODEL dropdown offers, given the selected provider
 * profile — the honesty half of docs/PROVIDERS.md's tier mapping.
 *
 * The picker has always chosen a TIER, not a model. Without a profile the tier
 * resolves to Anthropic's own model and "Opus / Sonnet" says everything there is
 * to say. With a profile it resolves through that profile's
 * ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_<TIER>_MODEL instead — so a dropdown still reading "Opus /
 * Sonnet" never says what will actually run, which is exactly how an operator
 * reads a provider picker as having no effect. Here the options become
 * `Opus → deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`, and a tier the profile does NOT map is not
 * offered at all: the spawn route refuses it (400), so offering it is worse than
 * hiding it.
 *
 * Lives in lib/ rather than inline in a card because BOTH spawn forms need the
 * same answer, and because this — which options, which labels, which fallback —
 * is the part worth testing without a DOM (modelTiers.test.mjs).
